    "Now that I've finished the course material and worked through the capstone project.... This OK Cupid dataset does not seem to have any serious clustering or correlations in the actual data. I've not been able to uncover anything that would lead me to believe it's a dataset that would lead to any really solid predictive capability. Reading some of the Slack content, it seems my fellow students encountered much the same.\n",

    "One of the things we were asked to consider was the performance of the various analysis techniques. Sure... Looping to determine the best gamma and C for the SVC classifier took about 15 minutes. But really, what's so wrong with a software execution that runs in less then a 1/2 hour?...... except when you have to be in a CEO boardroon in 5 minutes...LOL!!\n",

Before this point, the facility was run purely on paperwork, and managed by a bunch of cigar chomping type A personalities that didn't know how to turn a computer on. I can honstly say that 10 percent of my problems were technical and 90 percent political. I managed to succeed, but also honestly amazed that I lived through it!!\n",

    "Lastly, I would like to thank moderator Albert and all the folks at CodeCademy who were involved in creating the Machine Learning Fundamentals Course. I thought it was very well timed and paced for working professionals with other concurrent responsibilities. I am very happy with the content and am considering next steps by taking on the fast.ai course. I'm told it's a little more 'boiler plate' as far as working with this stuff on a real world day to day basis.\n",
